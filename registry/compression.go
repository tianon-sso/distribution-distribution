// additional gzip/deflate pass, so compressHandler skips re-compressing it.
//
// Detection works on the blob's actual bytes, not any declared media type:
// a blob referenced only by digest has no media type of its own (that's a
// property of a manifest's reference to it, and this registry never even
// records one more specific than "application/octet-stream" -- see
// registry/storage/blobwriter.go), so media type isn't a usable signal here.
// Sniffing real bytes instead also means this keeps working for any artifact
// type: if the ecosystem ever stops shipping gzip-compressed tarballs by
// convention and leans on transport compression instead, an uncompressed tar
// simply won't match any of these prefixes and will still get gzip'd on the
// wire like any other compressible content.

// Content-Length net/http would otherwise report accurately. The

// compressingResponseWriter defers the compress-or-not decision until the
// handler's first Write, so it can peek at the bytes actually being served:
//
//   - A Range/206 response is never compressed. http.ServeContent computes
//     Content-Range and (per its own documented "always set Content-Length
//     [for range requests]" rule) Content-Length from the uncompressed byte
//     offsets; silently gzip'ing the body out from under that would make
//     both headers describe bytes that were never sent.
//   - Content that's already in a recognized compressed format (typically
//     an OCI layer tarball) is passed through untouched.
//
// Because the decision -- and the resulting Content-Encoding/Content-Length
// header changes -- only happens once real body bytes exist to inspect, a
// response that never calls Write (including, redundantly with the HEAD
// check above, any handler that legitimately writes nothing) never spins up
// a compressor. That's what starves the bug described in compressHandler's
// doc comment: gzip/deflate's harmless empty end-of-stream trailer has
// nothing to masquerade as the whole response, because it's never written.
